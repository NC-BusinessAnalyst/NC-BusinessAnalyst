- 👋 Hi, I’m @NC-BusinessAnalyst
- 👀 I’m interested in how other business analysts have migrated from JIRA to Azure Dev Ops (ADO). I need tips on the editor. (How do you insert a grid?) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ADO functions and features. I am new to this!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on tips and tricks on using ADO.
